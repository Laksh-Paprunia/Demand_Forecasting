 # ðŸ“Š Demand_Forecasting

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a **Power BIâ€“based analytics solution** designed to monitor, evaluate, and optimize key areas of inventory and supply chain performance. It integrates data from procurement, demand planning, warehouse operations, and logistics to provide a **real-time, data-driven view** for decision-making.

The dashboard was developed using data models from the provided Excel datasets (`linear_trend_forecast.xlsx` and `best_forecast_model.xlsx`), enabling **forecasting** and **performance tracking** for supply chain KPIs.
